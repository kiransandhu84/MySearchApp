I'd recommend this to any parent of a toddler. | Great Value // 5.0 // 5 Jan. 2010 // By\n    \n    Gadget Girl\n  \n on 5 Jan. 2010 // I purchased this book for a little boy of 5, who, because of a physical disability, has limited use in his arms and hands.  I have been waiting to hear from his mother to learn how he got on with it before writing this review.  She told me the book was a good size for her son (A5)and the pages, being thicker than normal, are reasonably easy to turn. The dabber supplied with it was a good size for him to hold and does not run out of water too quickly, therefore he was kept amused for ages.  He loved watching the different farm animals appear and the picture revealed was bright and cheerful.  After about 10mins the picture disappears as it dries and is quickly ready to use again. She considers these books to be a good idea for children that have limited movement in their hands and/or arms as they feel a sense of achievement knowing they have made the picture appear themselves.  There is no mention in the description of this book that it is reuseable and I think that should be added as it is a big bonus. As for me, I have more young children to buy presents for and I will certainly have this particular one on my shopping list again, and will be looking for more of the same! | great for a rainy or sunny day - keeps kids occupied // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2010 // By\n    \n    mum\n  \n on 14 Dec. 2010 // bought one each randomly for twin 3 and a half year olds. brilliant. they love them. no mess. dry and repeat. twin 1 asked if his masterpiece could be put up on the wall so his face dropped a bit when he looked again and the picture had 'disappeared'! i explained it was a magic picture and he could play tricks on other members of the family. his face lit up and he began 'colouring' again then 'doing magic tricks' with the pics to family members - they haven't left them alone. cheap and easy. recommended. | Water painting // 3.0 // 5 Jan. 2013 // By\n    \n    Mrs M\n  \n on 5 Jan. 2013 // Good to keep them busy for a short amount of time, keep one in my bag if we go to a restaurant or in the car, too much water does damage the pages slightly and we use an aqua doodle pen rather than the one supplied because it leaked a bit | Good clean fun! (literally) // 5.0 // 28 April 2013 // By\n    \n    Balancedreviewer\n  \n on 28 April 2013 // Every parent should have one of these!  There will always be times when you want your child to sit quietly - visiting the grandparents, going to a restaurant or just letting their dinner go down and these are just the ticket.  A practical alternative to messy activities like painting and drawing, they just use water.  The pad is A5 size so easily fits into a changing bag and can be whipped out when boredom sets in.There are 8 different pages and when they are drawn over using the water pen (included) the colours come to life to reveal lovely farm pictures.  I had some of these books as a child which I remember being a bit green/grey but these are for the new generation - the colours are vibrant and they quickly dry out and can be reused.The farm scenes are appealing for all children and suitable for both boys and girls.  There are some lovely \"hidden\" details too.These are designed to be used by children 3 years + but I have bought it for my 18 month old and she loves it.  She initially used a paintbrush dipped in water but now uses the water pen provided.  I remove the cap of the water pen which is the only obvious hazard.  Really cannot recommend highly enough. | Brilliant idea... an A5 size reusable (water) colouring book // 5.0 // 5 Sept. 2010 // By\n    \n    Rachel\n  \n on 5 Sept. 2010 // We were given one as a present and i've since bought several as gifts for others. We already had a Aquadraw mat and like the concept of using a pen which fills with water to draw / doodle / play, as there is no mess, its reusable and handy to take to friends houses, restaurants and in the car.This is more of a colouring idea than the Aquadraw mat but still great for our 2 year old daughter to doodle, chat about the pictures she is uncovering and generally distract her for chunks of time. They are relatively cheap, durable and a good size to take out and i'd definitely recomment them. The only thing i'm not so keen on is the size of the lid of the pen (as we have a younger baby) and comparing the pen to the Aquadraw mat pens i'm not sure why these ones have lids which could potentially be swallowed while Aquadraw mat pens don't have lids at all. But isn't a big issue - just means we are careful about not leaving it lying around. | Good product which we have used over and over again! // 4.0 // 11 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    monicaburns\n  \n on 11 Aug. 2014 // Love this concept and would buy this product again, but there are a couple of minor downsides to aware of to prevent frustration. Mainly, my little figured out that she could scratch the surface of the pages and removed the \"film\" that makes the picture appear, so on the first day ours was marred by fingernail scratches on a couple of pages. The other less problematic bit is that the backing of the pages is a compact cardboard-like material. That means that when the pages get wet from the water the page goes a bit soggy temporarily. We have however used this over and over again and it dries out with no problem! The pen with water has worked well, though occasionally dispenses a bit too much water. All in all, this is a great product with a couple minor flaws. I would recommend this product and the seller as it's been quite useful and was delivered early! :)"],"manufacturer_str":["Galt Toys"],"AvgReview_str":["4.4 out of 5 stars"],"description_str":["Six reusable pictures on thick board to colour with the water pen.
